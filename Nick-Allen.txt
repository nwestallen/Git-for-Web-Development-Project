Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
        Block elements take up entire lines on a page while inline elements take only as much width as the content requires
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
        The element exhibits sticky behavior, staying in one place as the user scrolls past other content
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
        display: inline-block;
    4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        Block: <p>, <h1>, <div>
        Inline: <span>, <a>
        Inline-block: <img>
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
        The box model specifies different regions of a container that can be sized and styled in CSS:
        Content: the innermost region that comprises the content
        Padding: an invisible layer between the content and border
        Border: a line that can be styled and colored around the padding
        Margin: invisible space beyond the border that pushes the container away from other elements
        The "fix" for the box model to get things to size intuitively is to give the container the following property: box-sizing: border-box;
